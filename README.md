# Fast Secure File Transfer
This project presents the development of a new file transfer application that uses the TCP protocol with sliding window technology. The application is designed for client-server communication and aims to provide a fast, reliable, and secure way to transfer files. The project is divided into two parts. In the first part, a client requests a file from other connected clients and establishes peer-to-peer connections with those clients to retrieve the file. The client also determines the bandwidth available for file transfer and requests the file in chunks based on this information. The connected clients encrypt and send the requested chunks to the client, who then verifies the integrity of the received file. In the second part of the project, a client sends a file to all connected clients using peer-to-peer connections. The file is first compressed to reduce its size, and then processed and encrypted before being sent to the clients. Each client receives a different chunk of the file and immediately sends it to the other clients, while also processing and decrypting the received chunk. The sender and receiver clients verify the transferred file using a secure hashing algorithm. Overall, this project aims to provide a reliable and efficient way to transfer files in a client-server environment, utilizing the benefits of peer-to-peer communication.
